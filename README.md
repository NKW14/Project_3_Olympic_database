Purpose of Project

Our objective was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of historical Olympic results by examining two distinct data sets to assess athlete performance improvements, growth in global presence, and overall country performance. The team aims to present data-driven insights on prevailing trends, including the evolution of team achievements, and to evaluate how countries' standings have shifted over time.

Instructions on how to use database:
	 

The intent of the database is to provide users with insights into country performance across selected Olympic events. It enables users to access historical results and evaluate overall performance by country. Additionally, users can examine individual events to analyze the criteria for achieving a top-three finish. While the data model does not forecast future performance, it allows for speculative analysis based on historical trends to infer the physical requirements necessary for success in upcoming events.


Ethical considerations

The datasets selected for our analysis pertain to Olympic results across various events for both men and women. Since participation in the Olympics is voluntary and results are publicly available, consent for data release is not required. The datasets include comprehensive results of all athletes, ensuring transparency and minimizing bias. Although some trends may reflect higher performance by certain countries, this is attributed solely to athletic performance rather than any data distortion.
To uphold the integrity of the competition, all athletes are subject to monitoring under the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) Anti-Doping Rules, which mandate both in-competition and out-of-competition testing to ensure compliance. Additionally, the IOC oversees the judging process for individual and team events, with judges appointed from international sports federations to prevent any national bias.
Given these stringent standards for performance and reporting, we are confident that the data analysis conducted is both valid and ethical.
